# Setup
To run the project synchronize your schema with your database by running `make db-push`, then start the Go API with `go run main.go` or use Air for hot reloading by just running `air`.

For the UI make sure you have at least NodeJS v18.16.1 installed, then run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` to start the Vue app.
